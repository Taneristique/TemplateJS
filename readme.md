#General Information
This is an experimental template which is done in  order to better understand the principles of classical programming.I am glad of this template because finally I solved how can I add a language translation or background themes in proper way.Actually in taneristique swap template there was a bug on background theme('It was so hard passing from black theme to white theme 
with correct toggle symbol').In this work I learnt the reason causes this bug.That bug happened because I assigned a variable to the value of localStorage and whenever i reopened the page 
my variables value changed to setted value,and this manipulated my localStorage's value in wrong way and this case caused the bug on theme changing.In this template I did not assign 
a variables value to localStorage instead I assign localStorage's value to a variable to make if else if statement with less character than normal.This was the technic part of this 
fun template.If we speak about other part,you will find a lot of suprises I hope you will like itðŸ˜Ž
